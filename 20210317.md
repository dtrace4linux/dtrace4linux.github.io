# [20210317] Raspberry Pi Frustrations

Having spent the last few weeks with 3 Raspberry Pis (model 3 and 4),
getting wifi to work, reliably is very tiring. Whilst most web pages
quickly home in on how to setup the wifi, i.e. the files in /etc, 
which changed across Raspian/Debian versions, there are various complaints
of wifi issues.

For some groups of people, bad router placement and PSU issues may be
a root cause.

But my issues are much more deep seated than that.

After a lot of playing around, here is what I am finding. I am
using various routers and a mesh router, so I can easily switch between
them.

If I use DHCP, it works reliably. If I try to use static IP, it does not.
I either cannot associate with the router, or can associate, but no
traffic moves.

I tried out Ubuntu, and got pretty much the same results, implying
it is *me* that is the problem - something happening which I am not
experienced enough to resolve. Both on Raspian and Ubuntu, the
cfg80211 driver will kernel stack trace. Suspicion on the web is
that a hidden router, with an all-zeros SSID, causes this. With
so many devices in the house, and the neighbours, it is difficult to
determine which hidden device is causing the issue.

Whilst using DHCP, I have a non-determistic IP address, which means
ssh-ing to the device is a nuisance. Whilst many web sites say the
right place to configure static IP's is on the router, thats not
helpful when you have various router devices, and some are not
configurable. (The mesh provides zero admin options). The mesh connects
to a normal router, so, yes, I can plumb in the mac address into the router.

That just complicates the network - with the router having config,
and me failing to remember what I may have done, some years down the
line when its time to upgrade the router.
