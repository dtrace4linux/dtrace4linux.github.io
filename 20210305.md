# [20210305] Frustrations with Raspberry Pi's

I have been using Pi's for years, as will most of you out there. My
first Pi - a Model 1, was fine. Worked reliably for years, although
limited in disk size, but ok.

I skipped the Model 2 generation and got a 3 and a 4.

I didnt get to use the Model 4 much, but did put the Pi3 to use as a
music server, and this works well. I did have some issues with wireless
and headless operation, but it works.

I started a new project for the Pi 4 - an integral/small screen, and
have had nothing but serious pain with it.

Setting up the Pi is easy, as per normal. But its so frustrating that
'ssh' is not enabled by default, but easily rectified.

Setting up the wifi should work. And did. For a bit. And then...

## And Then there was nothing

The cable network works flawlessly - plug it in, it works. Disconnect -
all comms stop. Repeat.

But wifi?

No. The wifi only 'works' if the cable is plugged in.

...

Take a moment to absorb that: wifi works if the cable is plugged in.

And so began my long journey to figure out why a fundamental issue
was so utterly broken.
